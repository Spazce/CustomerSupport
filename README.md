		<h1>Customer Support</h1>
		<p>Now that you are the proud owner of a <b>Packt book</b>, we have a number of things to help</p>
		<h2>Errata</h2>
		<p>Although we have taken every care to ensure the accuracy of <br /> our content, mistakes do <br /> happen. If you find a mistake in one of our books—maybe a <br /> mistake in the text or the <br /> code—we would be grateful if you would report this to us. By <br /> doing so, you can save other <br /> readers from frustration and help us improve subsequent <br /> versions of this book. If you find <br /> any errata, please report them by visiting <br /> http://www.packtpub.com/submit-errata, <br /> selecting your book, clicking on the errata submission form link, <br /> and entering the details of <br /> your errata. Once your errata are verified, your submission will <br /> be accepted and the errata <br /> will be uploaded on our website, or added to any list of existing errata, under the Errata <br /> section of that title. Any existing errata can be viewed by <br /> selecting your title from <br /> <u>http://www.packtpub.com/support.</u></p>
